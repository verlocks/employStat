We aim to give some insights to the others by analyzing the past several year’s data from the U.S. Bureau of labor statistic because employment would be an essential topic for the most people, especially for the young people, who are more likely to look for a position in a company instead of have their own business. Thus, as relevant to many people, the topic which relates to many people, from our perspective, would be interesting and useful. Besides, since employment situation involves many aspects, and thus we’d like to analyze this topic from different angel to try to provide as many useful information as we can. The questions we are interested in studying: In the recent period, does it exists discrimination in employment in different industries? Politicians often mention increasing employment rate and improve the public living conditions in their public speech. In the recent decades, does the employment situation truly improved? With the development of the society, does the requirement of each industries for their positions become more strict?

To assure the correctness of the data sets, they are chosen from the U.S. Bureau of labor statistics. (link to dataset) and all the data is downloaded as excel for further analysis. At first, we decide which topic we would work on and several questions we may have, based on our point of view. Second, with the concern of the correctness and accuracy of the data, our group choose to use the data from U.S. Bureau of labor statistics. And U.S. Bureau of labor statistics offers a variety of data sets about employment from different perspective on the website, like employment status, characteristic of employed and characteristic of the unemployed, etc. Then, looking through the data sets combined with our potential questions wanted to explore, current knowledge and own interest, our group decide the questions we’d like to explore and choose the data set we would potentially use. To be more specific, the following offer the details about choosing the data set: 2.1 General View: “Employment status of the civilian non-institutional population, 1950s to date” : link_to_this_file since this data set would give us an overview of the employment status which would be beneficial for our whole analysis. Variables: It has 11 variables, gives the Year; Civilian non-institutional population; Civilian labor force information including the total number, Employed people including Agriculture and Non-agriculture, Unemployed number and these factors’ percentage; Not in labor force number. This gives bunch of information for us to choose in the further analysis. It has around 70 records Issue: There is no issues in this data set. 2.2 Question 1 It is asking about “does it exists discrimination in employment in different industries?”, the key point is discrimination which would involve gender, race, age etc. Thus, gathering the data in these topics would be essential.For this question our group gather the data set as follow: 2.2.1 “Employment status of the civilian non-institutional population 16 years and over by sex, 1980s to date”: link_to_this_file Since gender is one of the points to analyze the discrimination, this data set gives us the employment status of men and women 1980s, and using this data set would be potential useful for our data analysis. Variables: It has 11 variables and very similar to the general view of employment data set. gives the Sex and year; Civilian non-institutional population; Civilian labor force information including the total number, Employed people including Agriculture and Non-agriculture, Unemployed number and these factors’ percentage; Not in labor force number. It has around 83 records. Issue: There is no issues in this data set. 2.2.2 “Employed persons by detailed occupation, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity”:(from 2016 to 2020) link_to_2016 link_to_2017 link_to_2018 link_to_2019 link_to_2020 Our group choose the data from 2016 to 2020 since the website gives same format of data in the same topic from 2016 to 2020. This data set gives the information about the race vs occupation, so it could be potentially useful for further analysis since it is highly possible in different industry, the discrimination would be different. Besides, race is also a key point of discrimination. And choosing 2016 to 2020 is because the recent 5 years data would be more valuable for us to do analysis and give insights to the others. Variables: They all have 7 variables except in 2016 which looses white people information. The others’ variables including Occupation; Total employed number; percentage of total employed of women; percentage of total employed of White; percentage of total employed of Black or African American; percentage of total employed of Asian; Hispanic or Latino; They have around 560 records Issue: These files contain missing values. 2.2.3 “Employed persons by occupation, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and sex”:(from 2016 to 2020) link_to_2016-2017 link_to_2017-2018 link_to_2018-2019 link_to_2019-2020 These data set offers a more general version about occupation, gender and race, compared to the previous one. And it is also potentially valuable for our group for further analysis. Variables: They all have 7 variables including the occupation and race; Total for both years; Men for both years; Women for both years. For each one, there is around 85 records. Issue: There are no issues in these files. 2.2.4 “Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population by age, sex, and race”:(from 2016 to 2020) link_to_2016 link_to_2017 link_to_2018 link_to_2019 link_to_2020 These data sets offer the information about different age and different race in different ages, which could provide us another angel of viewing the employment status. Thus, these data sets could be highly potentially useful for the further analysis Variables: They all have 9 variables in total, including the different gender and race in different age; Civilian non-institutional population; Civilian labor force total; Civilian labor force percentage; Civilian labor force employed total; Civilian labor force employed percentage; Civilian labor force unemployed total; Civilian labor force unemployed percentage; Not in the labor force. For each one, it has around 275 records. Issues: There is some missing values in these files. 2.3 Question 2 It is asking about the whether the employment situation has truly improved. In another angel, analyzing the unemployment would give us the answer to this question since based on the news, from the politicians’ words, unemployment rate will be improved based on his actions once he has been elected. However, whether they told the public the truth or not could only be verified based on the actual data. 2.3.1 “Unemployed persons by occupation and sex”(from 2016 to 2020): link_to_2016-2017 link_to_2017-2018 link_to_2018-2019 link_to_2019-2020 These data sets offer the information about the unemployment rate based on gender and occupation which could offer us the insights about the unemployment status. Variables: They all have 5 variables, with the occupation; total unemployment number for both years; unemployment rates for both years; unemployment rates of men for both years; unemployment rates of women for both years. Each one has around 32 records. Issues: There are missing values in these data sets. 2.4 Question 3 The question is: as the development of the society is becoming better, does the requirement of each industries become more strict? To answer this question, how to define the requirements seems essential. From our point of view, the percentage of having a license or certificate is an appropriate indicator for this question. Therefore, gathering the following data is reasonable. 2.4.1 “Certification and licensing status of the employed by industry and class of worker”(from 2016 to 2020): link_to_2016 link_to_2017 link_to_2018 link_to_2019 link_to_2020 These data sets give two parts useful information and both of them will be useful for the further analysis. The first part gives information about holding certificate or license (whether have both or only one) based on the industry. The second part offers another angel that the license or certificate holding situation based on which type the people himself/herself is. Variables: They all have 7 variables with industry and class of workers; total employed workers; percentage of total employed workers; percentage of with a certificate or license total; percentage of only having the certificate but no license; percentage of having license(could possibly also have certificate); percentage of not having certificate or license. For each file, there is around 34 records. Issues: There is no issues in these data files. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation link to the data transformation file Description: The data sets in our group are downloaded in excel file to the folder for further analysis. With looking at all the data files of ours, here are the problems for analyzing: 1. All of these data files have sub-headers which is not eligible for data analysis using r 2. the hears name is not that clear to understand the columns 3. the rows which have some relationships with the other rows do not have specific group variables for easily using R to analyze them. The procedure: Our group use python to do the data transformation and data cleaning part. Look at these data files, the actual missing values is marked with ‘-’. With this indication, the sub-headers and the separation rows are easily to be removed since the cell with nothing must be the space generated by the sub-headers or the separation row in the excel file. We could just drop these files and keep the actual missing values then deal with the missing values in different method based on the specific files. In addition, we change the header of the columns in order to simplify the further analysis process since the current header could not be an useful indicator for using R to the analysis. In the end, we also have add another extra column named ‘Group’ to most of the data files, which could be assigned group variables. With this action, the further analysis could be more effective, since we expect to do many group analysis and having such variable would save time to group them together. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 “Employed persons by detailed occupation, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity”:(from 2016 to 2020) 4.2 “Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population by age, sex, and race”(from 2016 to 2020) 4.3 “Unemployed persons by occupation and sex”", " Chapter 4 Missing values The files of files containing the missing values has been saved to an additional missing_data file to analyze missing patterns in this part. The code is included in the same file as in the data transformation file since we use python to do the data transformation and data cleaning part, having another file again import and export the files would be a waste of time. The Missing Values Pattern: (Since the headers for our data is longer then usual, we remove the x labels for the above bar chart for artistic) 4.1 “Employed persons by detailed occupation, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity”:(from 2016 to 2020) When using the files from 2016 to 2020, they all generate the same graphs so we only show the graphs for 2017 to do missing pattern analysis(since compare to the others, the files for 2016 does not contain the columns for White people): The Total Employed column does not contain any missing data while the other four (Percentage of women total employed; Percentage of white total employed; Percentage of Black or African American employed; Percentage of Asian total employed; Percentage of Hispanic or Latino total employed ) all have same amount of missing values: They all have 200 rows missing and around 37.5% of the rows are missing. With carefully looking at the data, there is no values could be put inside the empty cells. And because all the files have the same missing patterns and position, this should be designed to miss from the data set origin, and we choose to drop all of the rows having missing values. 4.2 “Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population by age, sex, and race”(from 2016 to 2020) Again, when using the data files from 2016 to 2020, they all generate the missing pattern graphs, we only use the the files in 2016 to do missing pattern analysis: There is only one column named “Civilian labor force_Unemployed_Percent of labor” has missing values and only have 3 rows contain missing value, and due to the number of records, the percentage is around 0%. When actually take a look at the missing values, they could be calculated by using the unemployment number divided by the total number of people to get the value. Thus for these kind files, we do not drop the rows but fill them by calculating them. 4.3 “Unemployed persons by occupation and sex” Looking at the graphs generated, there are 15 columns containing the missing values, and all have the same missing pattern. They all have 3 rows missing in each column, and the percentage is around 10%. Since all of them have the same missing pattern, it should be designed not to have values in the original data files. Therefore, for these rows, drop them would be the best choice. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Overview of Employment Statistic 5.2 Discrimination in Employment 5.3 Change of Employment Situation 5.4 Stirctness of requirement in the industries and workers’ type", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Overview of Employment Statistic Before we dive into the questions about the factors influencing the employment, it would be better that we have an overview of overall civilian labor force in order to understand the data following more clearly. Here, Civilian Noninstitutional Population is defined as persons 16 years of age and older residing in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, who are not inmates of institutions (e.g., penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces. Civilian Labor Force is defined as all persons in the civilian noninstitutional population classified as either employed or unemployed. The detailed definition of person’s employment state can be found here. As we can see, Civilian Noninstitutional Population keeps increasing over time, as same as Civilian Labor Force and Civilian Labor Force Employed. The percentage here is calculated by dividing population of Civilian Labor Force and Civilian Labor Force Employed with Civilian Noninstitutional Population. The first statistic also can be referred as Labor Force Participation Rate. Both lines of percentage show a similar pattern. Despite of the increasing trend in overall population, the percentage of Civilian Labor Force and Civilian Labor Force Employed reach peak at 2000 and then decreased. A detailed analysis of Labor Force Participation Rate can be find here, which is not the topic we tend to discuss here. It should be noticed that Labor Force Participation Rate is influenced by social, demographic, and economic trends. Therefore, it’s complicated to explain the change of this statistic over time. The Unemployment Rate is defined by the ratio of unemployed to the civilian labor force expressed as a percent [i.e., 100 times (unemployed/labor force)]. Therefore, the Unemployment Rate indicates what degree of people who try but can not find a job. As we can see, the Unemployment Rate changes rapidly over time and in 2020 it reached another peak again. Despite the constant change over time, the Unemployment Rate hovers around 6% in general. 5.2 Discrimination in Employment Now we want to find out whether it exists discrimination in employment in different industries in recent period. 5.2.1 Sex Discrimination First we examine the sex discrimination. From a whole review, we can see that women significantly had less Civilian Labor Force Percent and Labor Force Employed Percent of population, despite the increasing of Civilian Noninstitutional Population over time. It indicates that women are likely not to have a job or try to pursue a job compared with men, which shows discrimination in the overall employment. The graph also shows that the gap in Civilian Labor Force Percent between men and women has been narrowed in recent years, indicating the situation may be changing to a good way. However, as the last graph suggests, the Unemployment Rate for men and women shows a very similar pattern. Actually, the Unemployment Rate for women always shows a little bit less than men. This shows that it’s not more difficult for women to find a job if they want to in the overall picture of employment. Next let’s try to examine the sex discrimination in different occupation. Here we only display the occupations which have total employed population over 1MM, due to the large number of occupations. Data was collected in 2020, which shows the recent state of total employee and percent of women employee. From the graph we can find that there is a strong sex preference in a lot of occupations. For example, secretary and administrative assistant have a very strong tendency to women, which have over 90% of women employee. While in occupations related to construction, the percent of women employee is pretty low. Some discrimination in the graph may be explained reasonably. For example, construction laborers has a strong preference to men because the work requires strong physical labor and apparently it fits to men physically. Occupation of elementary and middle school teachers has a strong tendency to women, which may be resulted from the social common sense that women are more patient, considerate and obviously better at looking after children. However, such explains also indicate that the discrimination towards sex has deeply rooted at the culture and social common sense, which tell people what men should do and women should do. Besides, there are some occupations with discrimination towards sex, which can not be explained easily, such as software developers, computer and mathematical occupations, which have a tendency to men; bookkeeping, accounting and auditing clerks have a strong tendency to women. 5.2.2 Race Discrimination Now we focus on the discrimination towards races. Again we only display the occupations which have total employed population over 1MM, due to the large number of occupations. Data was collected in 2020, which shows the recent state of total employee and percent of employee of different races. We can find out that there is discrimination in different occupations, and the degree of it varies according to the occupation. Occupations related to computer science have a strong tendency to Asian compared with other occupations. If we read the graph carefully, we can find that Asian tend to have occupations with higher requirements of professional knowledge, especially related to field of science, engineering and finance. We can also observe that percent of Asian employee has a negative correlation with percent of White and Hispanic or Latino employee, but doesn’t seem to have a correlation with percent of Black or African American employee. This phenomenon can be explained by saying that in the recent decades many Asian come to the U.S. to pursue a Master or PHD degree, who tend to stay in the U.S. and continue their career. Still, the discrimination exists. 5.3 Change of Employment Situation Now we want to answer a question: How does the employment situation change in the recent years? Is there any improvement about employment in different industries? We can answer the first question according to the graph at first part. Civilian Noninstitutional Population keeps increasing over time, while the Labor Force Participation Rate reached peak at 2000 and then kept decreasing until now. The Unemployment Rate changes rapidly over time and in 2020 it reached another peak again. Despite of the constant change over time, the Unemployment Rate hovers around 6% in general. The conclusions above suggest that on the whole, the employment situation doesn’t improve, and may change rapidly due to external factors, such as COVID-19 and Great Recession. Now we want to examine the employment situation in different industries in recent years. The figure above displays the total unemployed population in recent 5 years in different occupations. Although different occupations have different degree of population, the trend looks consistent. We can see that almost all occupations share a same pattern: the unemployed population decrease slowly from 2016 to 2019, and then rapidly increase in 2020. Occupation about arming, fishing and forestry seems to be an exception, which increased a little in 2019 but decreased in 2020. The reason behind rapid increasing in 2020 is well known to everyone: COVID-19. It’s good to see that before 2020 the unemployment population have an overall deceasing trend in most occupations, which suggests a good trend in the employment situation. The graph above display the Unemployed Rate of total, men and women. The trend here is similar with the previous graph. Since we use the Unemployment Rate, we can now compare the employment situation between different occupations. For example, we can find that food preparation and serving related occupation suffered most in 2020 due to COVID-19 and people tend to stay at home instead of eating outside at restaurant. Besides, we can not find an obvious relation between Unemployment Rate of men and women, except they share a similar pattern due to external factors. According to the graph, the difference varies between different occupations. 5.4 Stirctness of requirement in the industries and workers’ type 5.4.1 The strcitness based on industries Background Knowledge: Certifications are issued by a non-governmental certification body and convey that an individual has the knowledge or skill to perform a specific job. A license is awarded by a government agency and conveys a legal authority to work in an occupation. Licenses are harder to gain compare to the certificates. Thus, to some extent, licenses are more strict than certificates. Based on the graphs above shows with a certificate/license total percent calculates the percentage of workers who has a certificate or licenses in the overall employed people in the industry, and here is divided in to several specific industries: Based on the information, we divide the levels of the percentage(the strict level) as follows: low: below 20% medium: 20%-30% high: above 30% For Agriculture and related industries: It suddenly drop from 2016 to 2017, from 13% to 11.9%, while rise form 2017 to 2018 and keep going down from 2018 to 2020, from 12.6% to 12.1%. But its overall percentage is low compare to the other industry, and in the recent years, its require for a license or certificate is decreasing For Construction industry: It almost keep going done from 2016 to 2020, more specifically, from 2018 to 2020, it has almost no changes. It shows the requirement to enter this industry is becoming less strict, but its strict level is medium. For the Education and health services: It goes done from 2016 to 2017, and keep almost the same from 2017 to 2019 while in 2020, it rises, from 46% to 47.4%. This means in the recent years, this industry is becoming more strict, and at the same time, this industry has high level of strictness. For the Financial activities: It keeps going done from 2016 to 2019 and rises in 2020, which returns to the value in 2017. Thus, although having some fluctuation, this industry has the sign of keeping the similar strict level. The strict level of this industry is medium based on its values. For the Information industry: It keeps going done from 2016 to 2019, and rise from 2019 to 2020 but the value is lower than in 2016. It actually become less strict but has the sign of becoming more strict. Its level of strictness is low. For the Leisure and hospitality: It keeps going done form 2016 to 2020, thus it would be reasonably to predict it would keep going done in the future years. Its strict level is low. For the Manufacturing industry: It decrease from 2016 to 2017 but keep going up from 2017 to 2020 with little fluctuation, thus we predict it would keep rising in the future years. The strict level is low. For the Mining , quarrying, oil and gas extraction industry: It drops a lot from 2016 to 2017 but rises from 2017 to 2018 and keeps the same from 2018 to 2019 then drops from 2019 to 2020. Thus, it would be reasonable to assume it would goes done in the future. Its struct level is medium. For the Other services: It rises a bit from 2016 to 2017 and keep dropping fro 2017 to 2019 and rises from 2019 to 2020 in a relatively large amount. Thus we would predict it would become more strict in the near future. The level of strictness is medium. For the Professional and business services: It drops from 2016 to 2017 and keeps fluctuating from 2017 to 2020. In this sense, it will have the sign of fluctuating in the near future. The strict level is medium. For the Public administration industry: It rises a bit from 2016 to 2017 but drops more from 2017 to 2018 and has small changes from 2018 to 2020. From this pattern, it is reasonable to assume it would keep total percentage as around 30% in the near future which is a medium value. For the Retail Trade: It keeps dropping from 2016 to 2018 and rises from 2019 to 2020 with speed slowing done. Thus, It is reasonably predict it would rise a bit in the near future. For the Transportation and utilities: It goes done from 2016 to 2018, dropping with a large amount and rises a little from 2018 to 2019 and drops a little from 2019 to 2020. So it is more likely to keep in this data range in the near future, around 21% to 22%. It strict level is medium. For Wholesale trade: It keeps going done from 2016 to 2018 and rise a lot from 2018 to 2019 and then drops a lot from 2019 to 2020. Thus, it is reasonably to predict it would goes done in the near future. Its level of strictness is low. Based on the analysis: The LOW strict industries are: Agriculture and related industries; Information; Leisure and hospitality; Manufacturing; Retail trade; Wholesale trade The MEDIUM strict industries are: Construction; Financial activities; Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; Other Services; Professional and business services; Transportation and utilities; The HIGH strict industries are: Education and health services; Public administration; The above graphs is to show the percentage of having a certificate but no licenses: Almost each industries keeps the same pattern as the overall patterns for license and certificate except Education and health services(only having certificate goes done from 2019 to 2020), Leisure and hospitality(only having certificate has rising from 2017 to 2018 instead of keeping dropping) and Retail trade(only having certificate drops from 2019 to 2020) Besides, the percent of only having a certificate is low in all industries, all belows 5% which means more people would prefer actually to gain a license. The above graphs is to show the percentage of having a license(a people have a license may also have a certificate): All of the industries keep the same pattern which is reasonable since having a license weight more in overall having a certificate or license The above graphs shows the employed people who have not a licenses: From the graphs and values, we could see that most people would not have license or certificate, the lowest industry, Education and health service, even above 50%. Considering the dividence of work in each industry, having a high value of license or certificate seems not reasonable but the patterns we evaluate above could still offer useful information for people to choose industries to work in. The above graphs shows the distribution in the industries: After comparing the graphs in these 5 years, we could see that that difference is little. And we could conclude from here that, the minimum requirement of each industry would keep the similar in the near future, without big fluctuation. And when people consider to choose to work in some industry, considering the license or certificate percentage would be useful for planning the overall career goal. 5.4.2 The strictness based on wokers’ type From this point, we look at the data in a different angle, by looking at the workers categories, whether previate industries, Federal, State, Local or Self_employment: From the above graphs, keep using the levels for strictness defined above: The LOW strict level: None The MEDIUM strict level: Federal; Private Industries; Self-employed workers, unincorporated; The HIGH strict level: Local; State Thus, the Local and state have high license or certificate requirement. Detailed analysis of the above graphs: For the Federal: It is in the medium level. It keeps going done from 2016 to 2020 except from 2018 to 2019 rising a little. Thus, we could predict it would keeps going done in the near future. For the Local: It is in the high level. It drops from 2016 to 2018 while rising from 2018 to 2020, back to the similar level. Therefore, it has rising trend in the near future. For the State: It is in the high level. It drops from 2016 to 2019 and rise relatively large from 2019 to 2020. Thus, it has the rising trend in the near future. For the Private industries: It is in the medium level. It drops from 2016 to 2018 and rises from 2018 to 2020, even exceed the values in 2016. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict it would rise in the near future. For the Self_employed workers, unincorporated: It is in the medium level. It drops a lot from 2016 to 2017 while rises a bit in from 2017 to 2018. However, it drops again from 2018 to 2019 but rises a lot from 2019 to 2020, back to the similar values in 2016. Thues, it is reasonable to predict it would rise in the near future. Based on the analysis above, the government jobs, federal, state and local would be more strict. Besides, four out of five has the pattern of rising beginning either in 2018 or 2019. Thus, it would be reasonable to expect rising in local , private insutries, self-employed and state. The above graphs shows the worker category with a certificate but no license: Most of them have the similar pattern except the self-employment workers which rises at first then drop and then rise instead of drop, keep the same and rise. And from these graphs, we could also see that the percentage of only have a certificate without a license is relatively low which could indicate that prople would prefer a license or a license would mainly useful but a certificate is not that useful The above graphs shows the percentage of having a license, but these people may also have a certificate: All of these five have the similar pattern as the overall percentage graphs, which also indicates that having a license is dominent in having a license or certificate. The above graphs shoes the percentage of not having a license or certificate: From these graphs we could also see that the percentage of not having a license or certificate is still large, which is consistent with the distribution of workers in each industry. The above graphs shows the distribution of the workers’ categories: From these graphs, from 2016 to 2020, all keep the similar pattern, which could tell us that the requirment of license or certificate is not an accident and would keep the similar in the near future The above graphs give a more fancy way to show the data of percentage of license or certificate in each industry, the darker red it is means more percentage, could be over 75%, the darker blue it is means less percentage, could be less than 25% Also the above graphs give a more fancy way to show the percentage of license or certificate based on the workers’ category, the darker the red is means more percentage, the darker the blue is means less percentage. Conclusion: Based on the analysis above, some industries would become more strict in the near future based on their current level of strictness: Education and health services; Manufacturing; Other services; Retail Trade; and the government related work categories would expect to become more strict. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component In this part we display the graph of total employment and percentage of women employee of different occupations. The similar graph has been showed previously. However, due to the limitation, it’s not wise to display all the occupations in a graph, since it’s hard for readers to see the exact number from the graph and it’s not proper to create a graph too long. Therefore, we instead use an interactive way to illustrate it. Readers can sort element in proper way and find the exact number by put the mouse on the bars and dots. It’s very interesting to see the gender composition of different occupations. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitations 7.2 Future Directions 7.3 Lessons Learned", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitations From the data we have, we may have a clue that in some industries the sex discrimination and race discrimination exist. However, it’s hard to explain reasons for it, and find out the real employment condition for different gender and different race. If we want to have an insight into such questions, the data we have may not be enough. Besides, the employment statistic is highly influenced by external factors. For example, the impact of COVID-19 resulted in the rapid increasing of unemployment of almost all industries. With such factors, it’s difficult to answer whether the employment condition has been improved. The data we have only illustrates the realty, but lacks the ability to have a deep and thorough analyze of it. In addition, when analyzing the strictness of requirements of each industries, they do not have a long term signal of changes like keep increasing for all the recent five years and this may due to the politics change.
